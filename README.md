# Filebucket client

<!-- * A short description of your application -->
Filebucket is a Dropbox-like app that allows users to upload files into a
virtual file system. Anyone can read or dowload files and owners can delete
or rename their own files. Filebucket stores information for the files on a
MongooseDB database and stores the files in an AWS S3 bucket. The client is
built using Bootstrap and Handlebars

<!-- * A brief explanation of the technologies (Node modules, Express middleware etc) used. -->

## Approach
For the front-end we primarily worked in pairs, switching drivers regularly.  This
enabled us to problem solve together.  We also broke it into small steps so that we could commit regularly once we knew our code for that step was functional.

## Challenges
<!-- * Notes on any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome. -->
Intially we were challenged with git merging without hitting any conflicts.  We overcame this by always working on a feature branch and assigning roles for merging in to development.  Communication was important in order to achieve this.

## Dependencies
```npm install``` to install dependencies
